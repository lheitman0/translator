### NOTE: To ensure that VSCode inherits the environment variables set in your .zshrc file, first navigate to your project directory using the terminal. Then launch VSCode with the code . command. This is important because environment variables defined in .zshrc are loaded into the terminal's environment, and starting VSCode directly from the terminal ensures it inherits these variables. If you start VSCode from a desktop icon or other GUI method, it may not have access to the same set of environment variables.
